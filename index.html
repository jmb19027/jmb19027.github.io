   <h1> Welcome to your Dream Vacation </h1>
    
    <div class="wanderlust"> <b>Wanderlust-n.- desire to travel</b><br>
I have never left the country and I desperately want to explore the world from Johannesburg South Africa to Iceland I want to see the immersive nature of different cultures. I also want to accept all cultures but I will never have the ability to learn about them unless I seek these locals out.</div>

	<p>As a child, I was an avid reader escaping to all parts of this world and worlds like Hogwarts desperately searching for ways to go see these plays because just reading about it was not enough. Years and years of asking Santa Claus to let me explore my mom takes me to New York for Spring Break.  After I stepped out of LaGuardia. I fell in love with the biggest melting pot in the world.</p>

<p class="special"> All the people together in this bustling city made me feel at home and I never wanted to leave. Sadly after walking through Times Square, exploring central park and looking at places me and my Mom left exhausted. Hereâ€™s the thing I wanted to stay. At that moment I knew one thing New York is the place I am suppose to be.
